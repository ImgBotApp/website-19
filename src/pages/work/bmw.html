		headline="Finding a `solution` with empathy."
		text1="*BMW has stood for innovation in the automotive industry for close to 90 years.* As the e-commerce fever swept across and disrupted every industry, BMW knew they needed to align their innovative stance with its digital experience. SinnerSchrader was chosen to be their partner to launch the world’s first end-to-end e-commerce platform for the automotive industry, starting with the United Kingdom."
		text2="*Consumer research told us that buying a car had become a lengthy and complex process, involving intense decision-making.* At the same time, dealers felt threatened by the idea of online purchasing. Our solution was to create an experience that streamlined the end-to-end buying process, from aiding customer choices and the holistic integration of dealers to supportive sales conversions, whilst delighting with smart UX and design."

	<Story3
		headline="The need for `need` analysing."
		copy="*Car buying choices are based on both rational and emotional needs.* So we built a Need Analyser that analysed both, resulting in a recommended purchasable car model, which could then be furthered configured. Through extensive research, an accurate need matrix was compiled, allowing recommendations to be provided based on a mere four questions."

		headline="End-to-end `selling`."
		copy="*A complete end-to-end sales process was the targeted goal and hence dealer integration was pivotal to the success of the new platform.* We developed a powerful engine that integrated with BMW’s dealer network, allowing customers to contact local dealers and book test drives, whilst dealers were rewarded with direct sales leads."

		headline="Real-time `sales desk` along the customer journey."
		copy="*Whilst choosing a car is tough, it is still fun and rewarding.* But what comes after this decision can be rather daunting. Big or small questions about financing, insurance or payment can be stressful for consumers when left unanswered. To alleviate this anxiety, we built instant messaging tools to ensure help is available everywhere and at anytime."
