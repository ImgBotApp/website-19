		copy1="*Europa-Park in Germay is one of the largest theme parks in Europe.* Each year almost 5 million people go for the fun, thrill and entertainment. But theme park experiences were no longer just about the rollercoaster ride. As customers increasingly expected digitally enhanced services, Europa-Park needed to boost the whole park experience boost the whole park experience â€“ and their app could no longer support this."

		headline="Go, `Go`, Go content."
		copy="*Customers told us they felt somewhat anxious and frantic when in a theme park.* There was so much to do in so little time. We asked ourselves, what if we could escort them through the park to help alleviate their concerns? So we built a contextualised news feed that pushed relevant notifications throughout their journey, such as hotel bookings, shortest waiting lines and closest restaurants, to help make customersâ€™ experiences more simple and less frantic."

		headline="Tackling `complexity` with collaboration."
		copy="*One of the greatest challenge of the project was to integrate 200+ backend systems.* Second to this, was to create an app that was self updateable without the need to install a new version. This technically complicated task, not only required a large team of highly skilled developers, but a collaborative and communicative interdisciplinary team, from both sides of the partnership."
